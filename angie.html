<h1>Hi there! I'm Angie Toerner, Board Certified Integrative Health Coach.</h1>
<p>
Life is full of endless possibility. Within us all is a place of peace and serenity. We can lead deeply rich lives full of passion, adventure, and gratitude. We can be content and happy and live an inspired life. We each have the ability to make the world a better place in our own unique way. We can contribute. We can enrich the lives of others. We are here to leave the world a little better than when we found it. However, I know how hard it is to think and live this way when you are dealing with an overstressed mind and a less than optimally healthy body.
</p>
<p>
I believe we have the ability to overcome our fretful mind, release our anxieties and stresses, and heal our bodies in a natural and holistic way. We can move past all the things that hold us back and shift toward a life that isn't about surviving, but instead thriving. But, it's all about having the right support and an individualized plan.
</p>
<p>
Through nutritional counseling, neurotransmitter testing, supplementation, meditation, and personal growth exercises you can expect to:
</p>
<p>
Manage stress and anxiety holistically
Increase feelings of peacefulness and joy
Improve your energy levels, focus and clarity
Learn how to implement self-care practices
Improve your physical health and increase your odds of living a long and healthy life 
</p>
<p>
I am a Board-Certified Integrative Health Coach and Yoga and Meditation Instructor.  I attended the Institute for Integrative Nutrition and completed my 200 Yoga Alliance teacher training certification at Eternal Health Yoga. Perhaps more importantly though, I have been there. Stress and anxiety left me feeling depleted and unable to focus. I was on auto pilot just trying to make it through the day.  I knew there had to be more to life than that what I was experiencing on a day to day basis. I wanted to grow, to be present to this beautiful world, and to become the best version of myself - physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 
</p>
<p>
I have learned how to manage my stress in a holistic manner without medication. I have stayed at my ideal weight since losing 45 pounds six years ago.  I have an abundance of joy and contentment in my life. I am full of gratitude and have the confidence to chase after my dreams. 
</p>
<p>
I now successfully coach my clients on how to live their best life. Sometimes the cause of our stress is an imbalance in the brain. Other times it is a less than ideal diet. A healthy body and a peaceful mind can be yours, and I'm here to help get you there.  
</p>
