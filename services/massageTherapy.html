        <em>Swedish Massage –</em> employs a variety of gentle movement techniques to relax and stretch muscles, improve circulation, and relieve physical and mental stress. It affects the nerves, muscles, glands, joints; flushes wastes from the tissues; and promotes health and well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Deep Tissue Massage –</em> is designed to loosen the bonds between or “unstick” the body’s connective tissues and muscles to encourage them to function properly again. Slower strokes and direct pressure or friction are directed toward deeper tissue structures of muscle and fascia to relax muscle tissue and relieve chronic muscle or joint tension and pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Medical Massage and Pain Management –</em> is the application of specific treatments targeted to a specific problem(s) the client presents with that is administered after a thorough assessment/ evaluation is done. The treatment goal is to attain specific outcomes and relieve pain. Target areas may include the upper or lower back, neck, shoulders, and upper or lower extremities.

        <em>Acupressure –</em> an ancient Asian healing art that uses finger pressure to press healing points that stimulate the body’s natural self-curative abilities. It uses the same pressure points and meridians used in Acupuncture but uses gentle to firm finger pressure rather than needles. Is effective in relieving pain and muscular tension, balancing body energy, promoting circulation, and boosting the immune system to stimulate self-healing and promote greater spiritual and physical vitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Manual Lymphatic Drainage -</em>  a gentle, rhythmic form of massage that stimulates the lymphatic system to carry away excessive fluid and wastes in the loose connective tissue.  This non-invasive, painless therapy is useful in treating conditions such as acute and chronic edema (swelling), neuro-muscular disorders, headaches, and acne.  It is an effective therapy for detoxifying the body, regenerating tissue, reducing the symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, alleviating cellulite tissue, and improving vitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Reflexology -</em> based on an ancient Chinese method, this therapy involves the application of pressure to specific points on the feet and hands which are associated with organs and systems of the body through neural reflex pathways or “zones”.  It is believed to stimulate body organs, relieve congestion and blockages of energy,  enhance circulation, relieve pain and stress, normalize organ and gland function. and relax the whole system.  It is a convenient therapy to use in cases where an area of the body is traumatized or diseased to the extent that direct manipulation is not appropriate.
