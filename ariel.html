Some of these include anxiety, depression, relationship issues, grief/bereavement, stress management, communication problems, trauma and family adjustment issues. Ariel is dedicated to creating a safe space for open and honest communication. She encourages the exploration of problematic areas in your life, as well as the examination of own personal and spiritual growth. She has experience working with all ages, from young children to older adults. She has training in art and play therapy, and can also provide life coaching and spiritual direction. Ariel is committed to offering a sliding scale fee in order to make therapy affordable.
     “Healing is an innate and integrative process that encompasses Mind, Body & Spirit. All parts of a person's life (physical health, mental wellness, emotional well-being, and spiritual beliefs and values) are interconnected and must be considered in order for genuine healing to take place. People who embrace the desire to find wholeness through healing, soon learn the importance of tending to themselves and their significant relationships. This can have a rippling effect in which people begin to accept themselves and others, tolerate difference, have compassion for humankind, and care for the environment.”

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <h3>Individual, Couple & Family Therapy</h3> 	
    <p>Therapy is a process of understanding ourselves and those with whom we have close relationships. The more we understand ourselves, our emotions and our behaviors, the better we can communicate, manage stress and function effectively in our lives and in our relationships. Through therapy, individuals, couples and families learn self-awareness, communication skills and conflict resolution so that their relationships are strengthened and personal growth and transformation can take place. 
Through a therapeutic atmosphere of listening and understanding, a safe and trusting space will be created in which you will feel feel that you can speak openly and honestly. We will work together to set and implement your goals and objectives in order to resolve individual, marital and family issues.
In therapy, people become more aware of their inner dialogue and processing, so that they are better able to understand patterns of thinking and behaviors that may cause them to feel anxious or depressed. Individuals, couples, and families can also gain deeper awareness about their emotional states of being, as well as unhealthy patterns of interaction. Therapy offers more effective ways of communication and better management of stress and anxiety levels. It also helps people to adjust to the many changes and transitions that occur in their lives. Through a combination of personal inner work and relationship strengthening, people can create healthier interactions between family members and increase personal and relationship satisfaction.</p>
