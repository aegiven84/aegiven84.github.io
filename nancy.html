<h1>Nancy Givens, LMT</h1>

<p>
Ms. Givens has had a varied career in public health, health and wellness promotion, education, and sustainability programming in addition to massage therapy. She became certified in massage by the Potomac Massage Training Institute when living in Washington, DC, in 1981, and later attended Natural Health Institute in Bowling Green, KY, to become licensed in 2005. She has been trained in and offers Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, medical massage and pain management, acupressure, sports massage and facilitated stretching, and zero balancing. At your first scheduled appointment, we will jointly review your medical history and presenting problems, and your personal goals for (the) massage and design a treatment plan that incorporates one or several of these methods.</p>

<h2>SERVICES & FEES</h2>
Massage Therapy

<p>Professional massage therapy services are offered that include relaxation massages as well as therapeutic treatments to promote deep relaxation and self-healing, enhance circulation, or focus on areas of muscle pain or injury. A variety of techniques are used.</p>

<p>Scheduling may be done by phone or email.  Appointments must be paid for at the time of service.  If you miss your appointment, you will be billed for it unless you cancel the appointment at least 24 hours in advance.</p> 

<p>Swedish Massage - employs a variety of gentle movement techniques to relax and stretch muscles, improve circulation, and relieve physical and mental stress. It affects the nerves, muscles, glands, joints; flushes wastes from the tissues; and promotes health and well-being.</p>

<p>Deep Tissue Massage - is designed to loosen the bonds between or "unstick" the body's connective tissues and muscles to encourage them to function properly again. Slower strokes and direct pressure or friction are directed toward deeper tissue structures of muscle and fascia to relax muscle tissue and relieve chronic muscle or joint tension and pain.</p>

<p>Medical Massage and Pain Management - is the application of specific treatments targeted to a specific problem(s) the client presents with that is administered after a thorough assessment/ evaluation is done. The treatment goal is to attain specific outcomes and relieve pain. Target areas may include the upper or lower back, neck, shoulders, and upper or lower extremities.</p>

<p>Sports Massage and Facilitated Stretching - complements a workout program and speeds recovery from the wear and tear that occurs from the strenuous movements associated with an  athletic or workout program. Can assist those who wish to maximize their performance.</p>

<p>Acupressure - an ancient Asian healing art that uses finger pressure to press healing points that stimulate the body's natural self-curative abilities. It uses the same pressure points and meridians used in Acupuncture but uses gentle to firm finger pressure rather than needles. Is effective in relieving pain and muscular tension, balancing body energy, promoting circulation, and boosting the immune system to stimulate self-healing and promote greater spiritual and physical vitality.</p>
