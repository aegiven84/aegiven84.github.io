        Darcie provides art therapy and counseling for individuals, familes, and groups as well as play therapy and parent coaching.  She enjoys assisting individuals along their creative journey and believes all people have the power to create art and gain energy and healing from the creative process.  Therapy sessions typically last 45 minutes to an hour and participants will have a variety of mediums available for self expression and discovery.  Parent coaching sessions typically occur in a family session though sometimes Darcie will meet with parents individually to discuss family needs and current difficulties.
