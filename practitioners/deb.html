      <h1>Deb	Ogburn,	REAT</h1>
      <h2>Expressive	Arts	Therapy,	Coaching &	Consulting</h2>
      <p>Deb	Ogburn facilitates	healing,	wellness,	personal	growth and authentic	expression using visual	arts,	sound/music,	dance/movement,	literary and	theater arts.	She	completed	her	professional training	at the	Expressive	Arts	Institute	San Diego,	prior	to	studying	with	Expressive	Arts Therapy founders	and	authors	at	European	Graduate School	in	Switzerland.	Deb received	her	master's degree	(MA) in Expressive	Arts	Therapy,	Coaching	&	Consulting from	EGS	in	2006.	She became	registered	(REAT) with	the	International	Expressive	Arts	Therapy	Association	(IEATA.org)	in	2011.</p>
      <p>Expressive	Arts	Therapy entails	art-making	as	a safe	container	for	difficult	feelings	such	as	fear,	anxiety,	anger,	loss,	depression	and	low	self-esteem.	Often	used	as	a	treatment	for	trauma,	expressive arts	therapy	is	also	helpful	in	reducing	stress	caused	by	change	and	uncertainty	in	daily	life.	There	is no	need	for	artistic	"talent"	or	experience	to	benefit.</p>
      <p>Expressive	Arts	Coaching engages	the	whole	person in	the	imaginal	realm	of	arts-play.	Deb	helps	individuals,	couples and	work	groups	de-center	into	art-making	and	harvest	the	wisdom	of their images	and	experiences	to	break	through	blocks	and	create	desired	outcomes.</p>
      <p>Call	(502)208-4062	ext.	3 to	schedule	a	FREE	30-minute	consultation	to	meet	with	Deb	and	discuss	your	goals.	Private	pay;	sorry,	no	insurance	accepted.	Sliding	scale	available.</p>
      <p>Consulting.		In	addition	to	her	private	practice,	Deb	consults with	various	organizations	to	provide	expressive arts	programming.	She	has	facilitated burnout	intervention programs	for	UCLA Healthcare	and	the	Center	for	Community	Solutions in	San	Diego,	as	well	as	team	building workshops	for	businesses	and	social	service	organizations.	Currently	Deb	represents	the	Kentucky Center	Arts	in	Healing	program	facilitating	expressive	arts	groups	for	partner organizations including	the	Robley	Rex	VA	Hospital,	Volunteers	of	America,	Home	of	the	Innocents, the	Center	for Women	&	Families,	Nazareth	Home	and more.	She	also	works	with	women	in	transition	at	Prodigal Ministries	and	with	youth	programming	for	Kentucky	Refugee	Ministries.</p>
      <p>Call	(502)208-4062	ext.	3 to	speak	with	Deb	about designing	an	Expressive	Arts	program	for	your organization.</p>
