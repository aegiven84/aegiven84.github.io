      <h1>If something in your life is lost, broken or missing, ART can help!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Deb Ogburn</strong>, creator of A Time for Art. For as long as I can remember, the arts have been my way of making sense of the world and my place in it. Art-making helped me recover from trauma and loss. It has helped me discover who I am and feel authentic. It has opened doors to connection and community. Now I am privileged to help others recover, discover and connect through creative expression.

      <h3>Expressive Arts Coaching</h3>
      <p>
        An Expressive Arts Coach since 2000, I facilitate private sessions, workshops and groups that harness the healing power of your imagination and creativity. (Yes, you ARE creative.) My clients are veterans suffering from PTSD and substance abuse; adults and teens with depression, low self-esteem and other mental challenges; professionals, entrepreneurs and caregivers struggling with burnout; overwhelmed moms, sons and daughters caring for aging parents; students side-lined by stress and anxiety; people grieving a loss; and artists of all genres feeling stuck or blocked. But you don't have to be "artistic" to benefit; our time together is more about the process than the product. Learn more <a href="http://www.atimeforart.com/#!expressive-arts-coaching/ch53">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>MnemeTherapy&trade;</h3>
      <p>
        As Louisville Metro's first Certified MnemeTherapist, I also use the arts to help individuals with Alzheimer's Disease, Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders, Huntington's Disease, Lewy Body Disease, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Traumatic Brain Injury, stroke survivors and other neurological dysfunctions. Through a process involving singing, movement, directed painting, storytelling and praise, clients and/or their caregivers report improvements in memory, communication, socialization and sensorimotor skills. And each time they come to a session, they experience the reward and satisfaction of creating a beautiful painting! Learn more <a href="http://www.atimeforart.com/#!blank/qruxj">here</a>.
