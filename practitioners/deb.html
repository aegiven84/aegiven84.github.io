        Even longtime practicing artists can hit a blockage. Deb helped me get back in touch with my own power and purpose through a series of carefully and caringly designed experiences. I recommend her highly.<br>

        Deb created a safe and nurturing space...It seemed that each of us was impacted in some wonderful way...<br>

        I would like more opportunities to do this on regular basis so that I keep coming back to this experience which will remind me to speak to myself nicely, treat myself nicely, cherish myself and avoid falling into self-sabotaging behaviors."<br>

      <p>
        I felt like I found a couple more pieces to the puzzle, I made a few more connections within myself.<br>

      <p>
        I want to make art more a part of my daily routine. I limit my creative expression and would like to stop doing this. I had such a fun time...I want to do those kind of creative activities more.<br>

        You don't need any artistic talent or skill.
      </h4>
      <p>
        In expressive arts, the focus is not on craft; it's the experience of making and being present with your images that's important.  Our "work" is done in the imaginal realm of play and experimentation with various art forms and media. It's kind of like going back to the way we learned as kids, before we embodied all the "shoulds" and "can'ts" and "been-there-done-thats". As your facilitator, I'll guide you through creative processes that have the potential to reveal new possibilities.

        Healing the past.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes there are past traumas that need to be addressed before a lasting change can be made. As a Registered Expressive Arts Therapist with over 12 years of clinical experience, I can help you use the arts as a safe container for strong or difficult feelings, so you can express and release anything that stands in the way of achieving your goals.
