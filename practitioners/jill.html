      <h1>Jill Morgan</h1>
      <p>Jill Morgan is a Marriage and Family Therapist dedicated to providing affordable, accessible mental health care. If you are seeking supportive, objective and non-judgmental assistance with relationship issues, sexuality, anxiety, depression and/or spiritual meaning in your life, these are her clinical specialties. Jill's goal as a therapist is to help you recover your self-confidence, feel empowered, and live into the life you envision. She works with a wide range of emotional and behavioral issues, striving to create a comfortable atmosphere that lends to a collaborative treatment process. Her ethical commitments to therapy include facilitation of an open and affirming therapy environment that celebrates human diversity. Jill's clinical experiences have included working with Immigrant families at the Instituto Pastoral de la Caridad, and Seven Counties' Youth Service Center in the Highlands. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Indiana University and a Master of Arts in Marriage and Family Therapy from the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Her background also includes visual arts teaching, music, music therapy, and mind-body healing. Jill is fascinated by neuroplasticity and the infinite possibilities inherent in our lives. Recently, she has been pursuing her research interests in a national study of how mental health care providers describe the process of spiritually integrated psychotherapy. </p>
