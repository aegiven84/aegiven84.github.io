Jennifer Beasley 

I provide therapy for children and their families to help them manage changes and challenges in their lives.  Using a combination of art, story, play and drama, I gently guide children to express themselves.  Through creative self-expression, difficult emotions can be explored and transformed, leading to a more peaceful family life.

I offer supervision for art therapy students, and am happy to share my experience in using art therapy with diverse cultures in a variety of settings.  

I received my Master's degree in Expressive Therapies from the University of Louisville, and am a licensed, board certified art therapist.
