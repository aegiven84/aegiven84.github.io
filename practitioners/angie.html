        Hi there! I'm Health Coach Angie - Angie Toerner
      </h1>
      <p>
        I believe life is full of endless possibility.  We can lead deeply rich lives full of passion, adventure, and gratitude. We can be content and happy and live an inspired life. We each have the ability to make the world a better place in our own unique way. We can contribute. We can enrich the lives of others. We can be present to our day to day life.  But, I also know how hard  this is when you are dealing with an over-stressed mind.
I believe we have the ability to overcome our fretful mind, release our anxieties and stresses, and heal our bodies in a natural and holistic way. We can move past all the worries, fears, and self limiting beliefs that hold us back and shift toward a life that isn't about surviving, but instead thriving. But, it’s all about having the right support and an individualized plan.
      </p>

        <strong>Through nutritional counseling, neurotransmitter testing, suggested supplementation, meditation, and personal growth exercises you can expect to:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><h4>Reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety and panic</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Reconnect to your spirit and increase feelings of peacefulness and joy</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Learn how to implement self-care practices</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Incorporate tasty healthy foods designed for optimal physical and mental health into your diet</h4></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am a Board-Certified Integrative Health Coach and Yoga and Meditation Instructor.  I attended the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, received a nutrition certification from eCornell, and completed my 200 Yoga Alliance teacher training certification at Eternal Health Yoga. Perhaps more importantly though, I have been there. Stress and anxiety left me feeling nervous, depleted and unable to fully enjoy my life. I was overcome with worry.  I knew there had to be more to life than that what I was experiencing on a day to day basis. I wanted to grow, to be present to this beautiful world, and to become the best version of myself – physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I have learned how to manage my stress, anxiety and panic in a holistic manner without medication. I am connected to my spirit and am happy with my physical body.  I have an abundance of joy and contentment in my life. I am full of gratitude and have gained the confidence needed to chase after my dreams.

        Sometimes the cause of our stress is an imbalance in the neurotransmitters of the brain (due to stress, age, poor diet, or a genetic predisposition). 
      </h1>
      <h1>
        Other times it is an unbalanced lifestyle. Whatever the cause is, a healthy body and a peaceful mind can be yours, and I’m here to help get you there.
